Jug 1 has a capacity of 4 gallons
Jug 2 has a capacity of 3 gallons

Let J1 and J2 denote the amount of water filled in Jug 1 and J2 respectively


----------Solution Path----------


Initial state : J1= 0  J2= 0


Amount of water in Jug 1 and Jug 2 :
J1= 0
J2= 3


Amount of water in Jug 1 and Jug 2 :
J1= 3
J2= 0


Amount of water in Jug 1 and Jug 2 :
J1= 3
J2= 3


Amount of water in Jug 1 and Jug 2 :
J1= 4
J2= 2


Amount of water in Jug 1 and Jug 2 :
J1= 0
J2= 2


Amount of water in Jug 1 and Jug 2 :
J1= 2
J2= 0


Goal achieved : Jug 1 is filled with exactly 2 gallons of water
